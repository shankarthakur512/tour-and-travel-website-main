              Hi, I'm Shankar, an engineer with a passion for technology and travel. I founded Travellogo to bridge the gap between local guides and travelers. I believe that the best way to explore a place is through the eyes of a local. With my experience in web development and my love for travel, I have created this platform to offer unique and personalized experiences for everyone.
